# Building blockchain brilliance: The ultimate Crypto Spend Analytics MVP

This comprehensive MVP design leverages decentri.fi's foundation to create a powerful analytics platform specifically for EtherFi Cash and Gnosis Safe users. The platform bridges a critical market gap by connecting yield farming performance with real-world spending capabilities while providing treasury management insights across multiple chains.

## Current decentri.fi foundation delivers versatility and scale

Decentri.fi provides an excellent foundation for our Crypto Spend Analytics MVP with its open-source, modular architecture that supports multiple blockchain networks. The platform already offers several components we can leverage:

- **Protocol tracking infrastructure** can be extended to include EtherFi Cash transactions
- **Unified API framework** standardizes interactions across different protocols
- **Multi-blockchain support** enables seamless integration with both Ethereum and Scroll L2
- **Token information tracking** provides essential underlying data for transaction analysis

To transform decentri.fi into a specialized EtherFi Cash and Gnosis Safe analytics platform, we'll need to develop custom endpoints, implement spending categorization, and create purpose-built dashboards. The platform's extensible nature makes it an ideal starting point rather than building from scratch.

## EtherFi Cash & Gnosis Safe: Unique technical requirements

### EtherFi Cash Architecture

EtherFi Cash operates through a sophisticated cross-chain architecture:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: Used for collateral management and staking/yield operations
- **Scroll L2**: Handles day-to-day spending activities and card settlements
- **Core components**:
    - UserSafe: Manages user-owned assets and permissions
    - L2DebtManager: Handles credit functionalities
    - PriceProvider: Supplies real-time price data
    - Settlement Dispatcher: Processes payment settlements

EtherFi Cash transactions generate rich on-chain data, including transaction types (collateral deposits/withdrawals, credit draws, debit payments), merchant information, and cross-chain references.

### Gnosis Safe Architecture

Gnosis Safe uses a multi-signature wallet framework with:

- **Proxy pattern**: Each Safe is a minimal proxy contract pointing to a master copy
- **Multi-signature authorization**: Requires multiple parties to approve transactions
- **Module extensions**: Optional components that enhance functionality

Gnosis Safe transactions include configuration changes, value transfers, contract interactions, and module transactions - each with distinct data structures and security implications.
